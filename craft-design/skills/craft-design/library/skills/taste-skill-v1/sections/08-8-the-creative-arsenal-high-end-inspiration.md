## 8. THE CREATIVE ARSENAL (High-End Inspiration)
Do not default to generic UI. Pull from this library of advanced concepts to ensure the output is visually striking and memorable. When appropriate, leverage **GSAP (ScrollTrigger/Parallax)** for complex scrolltelling or **ThreeJS/WebGL** for 3D/Canvas animations, rather than basic CSS motion. **CRITICAL:** Never mix GSAP/ThreeJS with Framer Motion in the same component tree. Default to Framer Motion for UI/Bento interactions. Use GSAP/ThreeJS EXCLUSIVELY for isolated full-page scrolltelling or canvas backgrounds, wrapped in strict useEffect cleanup blocks.

### The Standard Hero Paradigm
* Stop doing centered text over a dark image. Try asymmetric Hero sections: Text cleanly aligned to the left or right. The background should feature a high-quality, relevant image with a subtle stylistic fade (darkening or lightening gracefully into the background color depending on if it is Light or Dark mode).

### Navigation & Menüs
* **Mac OS Dock Magnification:** Nav-bar at the edge; icons scale fluidly on hover.
* **Magnetic Button:** Buttons that physically pull toward the cursor.
* **Gooey Menu:** Sub-items detach from the main button like a viscous liquid.
* **Dynamic Island:** A pill-shaped UI component that morphs to show status/alerts.
* **Contextual Radial Menu:** A circular menu expanding exactly at the click coordinates.
* **Floating Speed Dial:** A FAB that springs out into a curved line of secondary actions.
* **Mega Menu Reveal:** Full-screen dropdowns that stagger-fade complex content.

### Layout & Grids
* **Bento Grid:** Asymmetric, tile-based grouping (e.g., Apple Control Center).
* **Masonry Layout:** Staggered grid without fixed row heights (e.g., Pinterest).
* **Chroma Grid:** Grid borders or tiles showing subtle, continuously animating color gradients.
* **Split Screen Scroll:** Two screen halves sliding in opposite directions on scroll.
* **Curtain Reveal:** A Hero section parting in the middle like a curtain on scroll.

### Cards & Containers
* **Parallax Tilt Card:** A 3D-tilting card tracking the mouse coordinates.
* **Spotlight Border Card:** Card borders that illuminate dynamically under the cursor.
* **Glassmorphism Panel:** True frosted glass with inner refraction borders.
* **Holographic Foil Card:** Iridescent, rainbow light reflections shifting on hover.
* **Tinder Swipe Stack:** A physical stack of cards the user can swipe away.
* **Morphing Modal:** A button that seamlessly expands into its own full-screen dialog container.

### Scroll-Animations
* **Sticky Scroll Stack:** Cards that stick to the top and physically stack over each other.
* **Horizontal Scroll Hijack:** Vertical scroll translates into a smooth horizontal gallery pan.
* **Locomotive Scroll Sequence:** Video/3D sequences where framerate is tied directly to the scrollbar.
* **Zoom Parallax:** A central background image zooming in/out seamlessly as you scroll.
* **Scroll Progress Path:** SVG vector lines or routes that draw themselves as the user scrolls.
* **Liquid Swipe Transition:** Page transitions that wipe the screen like a viscous liquid.

### Galleries & Media
* **Dome Gallery:** A 3D gallery feeling like a panoramic dome.
* **Coverflow Carousel:** 3D carousel with the center focused and edges angled back.
* **Drag-to-Pan Grid:** A boundless grid you can freely drag in any compass direction.
* **Accordion Image Slider:** Narrow vertical/horizontal image strips that expand fully on hover.
* **Hover Image Trail:** The mouse leaves a trail of popping/fading images behind it.
* **Glitch Effect Image:** Brief RGB-channel shifting digital distortion on hover.

### Typography & Text
* **Kinetic Marquee:** Endless text bands that reverse direction or speed up on scroll.
* **Text Mask Reveal:** Massive typography acting as a transparent window to a video background.
* **Text Scramble Effect:** Matrix-style character decoding on load or hover.
* **Circular Text Path:** Text curved along a spinning circular path.
* **Gradient Stroke Animation:** Outlined text with a gradient continuously running along the stroke.
* **Kinetic Typography Grid:** A grid of letters dodging or rotating away from the cursor.

### Micro-Interactions & Effects
* **Particle Explosion Button:** CTAs that shatter into particles upon success.
* **Liquid Pull-to-Refresh:** Mobile reload indicators acting like detaching water droplets.
* **Skeleton Shimmer:** Shifting light reflections moving across placeholder boxes.
* **Directional Hover Aware Button:** Hover fill entering from the exact side the mouse entered.
* **Ripple Click Effect:** Visual waves rippling precisely from the click coordinates.
* **Animated SVG Line Drawing:** Vectors that draw their own contours in real-time.
* **Mesh Gradient Background:** Organic, lava-lamp-like animated color blobs.
* **Lens Blur Depth:** Dynamic focus blurring background UI layers to highlight a foreground action.
